    "CesiCDP (our team) is responding to ADEME's call for innovative, eco-friendly transport solutions by focusing on optimizing delivery routes. The goal is to design a route that connects specific cities and returns to the starting point, minimizing travel time while accounting for traffic variations. Using Operations Research methods, you aim to create a realistic model that meets logistical and environmental goals. Adding extra constraints could increase the model's realism, helping your team secure ADEME's attention, funding, and expand CesiCDP’s influence in sustainable mobility.\n",

    "This first deliverable presents the problem you are addressing as well as its context, rephrases the problem in a formal way, and studies its theoretical properties, especially complexity ones. On the one hand, you must propose a formal representation of the data, problem and goal to be optimised (remember to incorporate the additional constraints that you decide to address). On the other hand, you must rely on this formal representation to demonstrate the theoretical complexity of the problem in question. It is strongly recommended to include bibliographic references of scientific research articles or books in this Notebook.\n",
