    "#### **A. Why VRP and Not TSP?<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"wp\"></a>**\n",
    "This problem is categorized as a **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** rather than a **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** because:  \n",
    "- In the TSP, a single vehicle must visit all customers and return to the depot.  \n",
    "- In contrast, our scenario involves **multiple vehicles**, requiring the optimization of customer allocation to vehicles and the determination of the best route for each vehicle.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The VRP adds complexity compared to TSP, as it must address the assignment of customers to vehicles, while also considering factors like vehicle capacity and time windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **<u>Key Constraints</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Visit per Customer**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Each customer must be visited exactly once, and only one vehicle can serve each customer.  \n",
    "   - **Constraint Type:** Equality constraint.  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Ensures that no customer is missed or served multiple times, avoiding redundant or overlapping deliveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Depot Start and End**\n",
    "   - **Description:** All vehicles must begin and end their routes at the depot (node 0).  \n",
    "   - **Constraint Type:** Equality constraint.  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Ensures proper route closure for operational consistency and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Capacity Constraint**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Each vehicle has a maximum carrying capacity that cannot be exceeded by the total demand of its assigned customers.  \n",
    "   - **Constraint Type:** Hard constraint.  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Prevents vehicle overloading and ensures feasible route assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Time Windows**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Deliveries must be made within a specified time window for each customer.  \n",
    "   - **Constraint Type:** Hard or soft constraint (with penalties for violations).  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Improves customer satisfaction and ensures realistic delivery schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Service Time**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Time spent at each customer location for unloading or completing the service is included in the schedule.  \n",
    "   - **Constraint Type:** Operational constraint.  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Ensures realistic timing for routing and adherence to delivery schedules.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Delivery-Leave Continuity**\n",

    "   - **Constraint Type:** Flow conservation constraint.  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Ensures route continuity and prevents incomplete or disjointed paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Mathematic Modelisation<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"mm\"></a>**\n",
    "In this section, we present the mathematical modeling of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), defining the necessary constraints and objectives for optimizing the routes. Each constraint is formulated using decision variables that model the relationships between customers, vehicles, and the depot, with the goal of minimizing the total cost while adhering to specific requirements such as capacity, time windows, and service times. Additionally, we define a fitness function, which serves to evaluate and optimize the solution, ensuring that the routes are both efficient and feasible according to the problem's constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **<u>Fitness Function for a Simple VRP</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a basic **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**, the primary objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles while ensuring that all customers are visited exactly once. The fitness function can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Minimize } Z_{\\text{VRP}} = \\sum_{k \\in K} \\sum_{i \\in V} \\sum_{j \\in V} c_{ij} \\cdot x_{ij}^k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where:**\n",
    "- $c_{ij}$: The cost (e.g., distance or time) of traveling from node $i$ to node $j$.\n",
    "- $x_{ij}^k$: A binary variable that equals 1 if vehicle $k$ travels from $i$ to $j$, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- $V$: The set of all nodes (customers and depot).\n",
    "- $K$: The set of available vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fitness function simply minimizes the total travel cost, without considering additional constraints like vehicle capacity or customer-specific time windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **<u>From VRP to CVRPTW</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the simple VRP aims to minimize travel costs, real-world routing problems often include additional constraints, such as vehicle capacity and customer time windows. These extensions lead to the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW)**. The CVRPTW adds complexity by requiring that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vehicle Capacities:** Each vehicle has a limited carrying capacity, and the total demand of customers assigned to a vehicle cannot exceed this capacity.\n",
    "2. **Time Windows:** Each customer has a specific time window during which they must be serviced.\n",
    "\n",
    "To incorporate these constraints, the fitness function must account for **multiple objectives**, such as minimizing the total cost while adhering to these constraints. Additionally, the model must ensure feasible solutions by enforcing capacity and time window constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **<u>Fitness Function for the CVRPTW</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fitness function for the CVRPTW combines the objectives of minimizing the number of vehicles and the total travel cost, while ensuring feasible delivery times and capacity usage. A common formulation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Minimize } Z_{\\text{CVRPTW}} = \\left( \\sum_{k \\in K} T_k \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{k \\in K} \\sum_{i \\in V} \\sum_{j \\in V} c_{ij} \\cdot x_{ij}^k + \\sum_{i \\in V} s_i \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where:**\n",
    "- $\\sum_{k \\in K} T_k$: Total number of vehicles used.\n",
    "- $\\sum_{k \\in K} \\sum_{i \\in V} \\sum_{j \\in V} c_{ij} \\cdot x_{ij}^k$: Total travel cost (e.g., distance, time, or fuel).\n",
    "- $\\sum_{i \\in V} s_i$: Total service time for all customers.\n",
    "- $x_{ij}^k$: Binary decision variable indicating whether vehicle $k$ travels from customer $i$ to customer $j$.\n",
    "- $T_k$: Binary decision variable indicating whether vehicle $k$ is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **<u>Why Extend to the CVRPTW?</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Realistic Constraints:** In real-world applications, simple VRP models fail to capture operational challenges like limited vehicle capacity and customer time preferences. Adding these constraints makes the model more realistic and applicable to industries like logistics and supply chain management.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Minimizing Total Costs:** By multiplying the number of vehicles used by the total travel cost, this fitness function penalizes solutions that use more vehicles or inefficient routing. It ensures a balanced trade-off between reducing the fleet size and optimizing routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feasibility:** Enforcing time windows and capacity ensures that the solution is not only optimal in terms of cost but also operationally feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multi-Objective Nature:** The CVRPTW inherently involves multiple objectives (e.g., minimizing distance, adhering to time windows, and minimizing the fleet size). This fitness function integrates these objectives into a unified mathematical framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While the simple VRP focuses on minimizing travel costs, the CVRPTW addresses more complex, real-world challenges by incorporating capacity constraints and time windows. The fitness function evolves to balance multiple objectives, ensuring feasible and cost-effective routing solutions. By integrating additional constraints into the fitness function, the CVRPTW model becomes a powerful tool for solving practical logistics and delivery problems.\n",

    "   $$  \n",

    "VRPTW is an extension of VRP. In VRPTW, each customer has a specific time window during which they must be visited, in addition to vehicle capacity constraints.  \n",
    "To reduce VRPTW to VRP, we can consider a simplified case where time windows are the same as customer schedules, so they impose no constraints on delivery times. This simplification removes the time window constraints, reducing VRPTW to a standard case of VRP. Consequently, any algorithm that solves VRPTW can also solve VRP as a special case, indicating that VRPTW is at least as difficult as VRP.\n",

    "\n",
    "To establish that the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is in the class NP, we need to demonstrate that, given a candidate solution, we can verify its correctness in polynomial time. Specifically, we consider the Decision Version of VRP, where we ask whether there exists a set of routes for the vehicles such that all customers are served, all constraints are satisfied, and the total cost does not exceed a given value \\(k\\).\n",

    "  - Verification: For each vehicle, sum the demands of the customers on its route and ensure it does not exceed the vehicle’s capacity.  \n",
    "  - Time Complexity: Linear time $O(n)$, as it involves iterating through each route and summing demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **c. Routes Start and End at the Depot**  \n",
