    "#### **A. Why VRP and Not TSP?<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"wp\"></a>**\n",
    "This problem is categorized as a **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** rather than a **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** because:  \n",
    "- In the TSP, a single vehicle must visit all customers and return to the depot.  \n",
    "- In contrast, our scenario involves **multiple vehicles**, requiring the optimization of customer allocation to vehicles and the determination of the best route for each vehicle.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The VRP adds complexity compared to TSP, as it must address the assignment of customers to vehicles, while also considering factors like vehicle capacity and time windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **<u>Key Constraints</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Visit per Customer**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Each customer must be visited exactly once, and only one vehicle can serve each customer.  \n",
    "   - **Constraint Type:** Equality constraint.  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Ensures that no customer is missed or served multiple times, avoiding redundant or overlapping deliveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Depot Start and End**\n",
    "   - **Description:** All vehicles must begin and end their routes at the depot (node 0).  \n",
    "   - **Constraint Type:** Equality constraint.  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Ensures proper route closure for operational consistency and planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Capacity Constraint**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Each vehicle has a maximum carrying capacity that cannot be exceeded by the total demand of its assigned customers.  \n",

    "\n",
    "6. **Delivery-Leave Continuity**\n",
    "   - **Description:** After serving a customer, a vehicle must leave either to visit another customer or to return to the depot.  \n",
    "   - **Constraint Type:** Flow conservation constraint.  \n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Ensures route continuity and prevents incomplete or disjointed paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Mathematic Modelisation<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"mm\"></a>**\n",
    "In this section, we present the mathematical modeling of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), defining the necessary constraints and objectives for optimizing the routes. Each constraint is formulated using decision variables that model the relationships between customers, vehicles, and the depot, with the goal of minimizing the total cost while adhering to specific requirements such as capacity, time windows, and service times. Additionally, we define a fitness function, which serves to evaluate and optimize the solution, ensuring that the routes are both efficient and feasible according to the problem's constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **<u>Decision Variables</u>**\n",
    "In mathematical optimization and operations research, decision variables are the variables that represent the choices made in a problem. They are the unknowns that the optimization model seeks to determine or optimize. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), decision variables define the routing choices, such as the paths taken by vehicles, the timing of deliveries, and the allocation of customers to vehicles. These variables are used in the objective function and constraints to describe the system's behavior and ensure that the solution satisfies all the necessary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we define them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **$x_{ij}^k$**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Binary decision variable indicating whether vehicle $k$ travels from customer $i$ to customer $j$.\n",
    "   - **Value:** \n",
    "     - $x_{ij}^k = 1$ if vehicle $k$ travels from $i$ to $j$\n",
    "     - $x_{ij}^k = 0$ otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **$t_i^k$**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Arrival time at customer $i$ for vehicle $k$.\n",
    "   - **Value:** Continuous variable representing the time at which vehicle $k$ arrives at customer $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **$T_k$**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Binary decision variable indicating whether vehicle $k$ is used.\n",
    "   - **Value:** \n",
    "     - $T_k = 1$ if vehicle $k$ is used\n",
    "     - $T_k = 0$ if vehicle $k$ is not used\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **$q_k$**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Capacity of vehicle $k$.\n",
    "   - **Value:** Continuous variable representing the maximum load that vehicle $k$ can carry.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **$d_i$**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Demand of customer $i$.\n",
    "   - **Value:** Continuous variable representing the quantity or demand of customer $i$ that must be met by a vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **$s_i$**\n",
    "   - **Description:** Service time at customer $i$.\n",
    "   - **Value:** Continuous variable representing the time required to service customer $i$ (e.g., unloading, acceptance).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **<u>Fitness Function for a Simple VRP</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a basic **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**, the primary objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles while ensuring that all customers are visited exactly once. The fitness function can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Minimize } Z_{\\text{VRP}} = \\sum_{k \\in K} \\sum_{i \\in V} \\sum_{j \\in V} c_{ij} \\cdot x_{ij}^k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where:**\n",
    "- $c_{ij}$: The cost (e.g., distance or time) of traveling from node $i$ to node $j$.\n",
    "- $x_{ij}^k$: A binary variable that equals 1 if vehicle $k$ travels from $i$ to $j$, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- $V$: The set of all nodes (customers and depot).\n",
    "- $K$: The set of available vehicles.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fitness function simply minimizes the total travel cost, without considering additional constraints like vehicle capacity or customer-specific time windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **<u>From VRP to CVRPTW</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the simple VRP aims to minimize travel costs, real-world routing problems often include additional constraints, such as vehicle capacity and customer time windows. These extensions lead to the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW)**. The CVRPTW adds complexity by requiring that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vehicle Capacities:** Each vehicle has a limited carrying capacity, and the total demand of customers assigned to a vehicle cannot exceed this capacity.\n",
    "2. **Time Windows:** Each customer has a specific time window during which they must be serviced.\n",
    "\n",
    "To incorporate these constraints, the fitness function must account for **multiple objectives**, such as minimizing the total cost while adhering to these constraints. Additionally, the model must ensure feasible solutions by enforcing capacity and time window constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **<u>Fitness Function for the CVRPTW</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fitness function for the CVRPTW combines the objectives of minimizing the number of vehicles and the total travel cost, while ensuring feasible delivery times and capacity usage. A common formulation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Minimize } Z_{\\text{CVRPTW}} = \\left( \\sum_{k \\in K} T_k \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{k \\in K} \\sum_{i \\in V} \\sum_{j \\in V} c_{ij} \\cdot x_{ij}^k + \\sum_{i \\in V} s_i \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where:**\n",
    "- $\\sum_{k \\in K} T_k$: Total number of vehicles used.\n",
    "- $\\sum_{k \\in K} \\sum_{i \\in V} \\sum_{j \\in V} c_{ij} \\cdot x_{ij}^k$: Total travel cost (e.g., distance, time, or fuel).\n",
    "- $\\sum_{i \\in V} s_i$: Total service time for all customers.\n",
    "- $x_{ij}^k$: Binary decision variable indicating whether vehicle $k$ travels from customer $i$ to customer $j$.\n",
    "- $T_k$: Binary decision variable indicating whether vehicle $k$ is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **<u>Why Extend to the CVRPTW?</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Realistic Constraints:** In real-world applications, simple VRP models fail to capture operational challenges like limited vehicle capacity and customer time preferences. Adding these constraints makes the model more realistic and applicable to industries like logistics and supply chain management.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Minimizing Total Costs:** By multiplying the number of vehicles used by the total travel cost, this fitness function penalizes solutions that use more vehicles or inefficient routing. It ensures a balanced trade-off between reducing the fleet size and optimizing routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feasibility:** Enforcing time windows and capacity ensures that the solution is not only optimal in terms of cost but also operationally feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multi-Objective Nature:** The CVRPTW inherently involves multiple objectives (e.g., minimizing distance, adhering to time windows, and minimizing the fleet size). This fitness function integrates these objectives into a unified mathematical framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While the simple VRP focuses on minimizing travel costs, the CVRPTW addresses more complex, real-world challenges by incorporating capacity constraints and time windows. The fitness function evolves to balance multiple objectives, ensuring feasible and cost-effective routing solutions. By integrating additional constraints into the fitness function, the CVRPTW model becomes a powerful tool for solving practical logistics and delivery problems.\n",

    "**How They Work:** Heuristics use simple strategies like greedy selection (e.g., selecting the next best option) or local adjustments to improve solutions. For example, in routing problems, the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm assigns routes by selecting the closest available customer.\n",
    "##### **Advantages:**\n",
    "Quick and computationally cheap.\n",

    "Metaheuristic algorithms are problem-solving methods designed to find approximate solutions to complex optimization problems, especially those that are NP-hard. These algorithms are useful when the solution space is large or non-linear, like in the **Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW)**. Metaheuristics explore vast search spaces to find good-enough solutions in a reasonable time.\n",

    "- **Flexibility**: Can solve a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems, including VRPTW.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### **1. Algorithm Choice and Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Genetic Algorithm :  a class of metaheuristic optimization algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection and the principles of genetics. They are widely used to solve complex problems where traditional optimization methods might struggle.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Representation (Encoding)\n",
    "Chromosomes: In GAs, potential solutions are represented as chromosomes, often encoded as strings of binary digits (0s and 1s), real numbers, or other forms, depending on the problem. These chromosomes represent a candidate solution to the problem.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. Initial Population\n",
    "GAs start with a population of randomly generated solutions. The size of the population is a key parameter and can influence the performance of the algorithm.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  3. Fitness Function\n",
    "The fitness function is used to evaluate how good each solution (chromosome) is with respect to the problem. The fitness value determines how likely a solution will be selected for reproduction. The better the fitness, the higher the chance of selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Selection\n",
    "In the selection phase, solutions (chromosomes) are chosen based on their fitness to create offspring. Common selection methods include roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, and rank-based selection. Solutions with higher fitness have a greater chance of being selected.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  5. Crossover (Recombination)\n",
    "After selection, two parent solutions are paired and undergo crossover, a process where parts of their genetic material (chromosomes) are exchanged to create one or more offspring. This simulates biological recombination and introduces diversity into the population.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  6. Mutation\n",
    "After crossover, mutation introduces random changes to the offspring. This is done by flipping bits or modifying values at random positions in the chromosome. Mutation ensures diversity within the population and prevents the algorithm from getting stuck in local optima.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  7. Replacement\n",
    "The offspring created by crossover and mutation replace some or all of the old population, depending on the replacement strategy. The new population is then evaluated, and the process repeats until a termination condition is met (e.g., a certain number of generations or a satisfactory solution).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Ant Colony Optimization : is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm based on the foraging behavior of ants. It is particularly effective for solving combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), and Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). ACO mimics how real ants find the shortest path between their colony and food sources, with the help of pheromone trails.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Pheromone Representation\n",
    "Pheromone Trails: In ACO, ants use pheromones to communicate indirectly with each other. Pheromones are a form of chemical markers that ants leave on their paths. The strength of the pheromone trail influences the decisions of other ants to follow the same path.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Ant Movement (Solution Construction)\n",
    "Each ant constructs a solution (or path) by moving from one node to another, making decisions based on two key factors:\n",
    "Pheromone concentration: Ants are more likely to follow paths with stronger pheromone concentrations, which are considered more promising based on previous ants' experiences.\n",
    "Heuristic information: Some problems may include additional information (like distance or cost) that influences an ant’s path selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3.Exploration vs. Exploitation\n",
    "Exploitation: Ants prefer paths with high pheromone levels, which means they exploit the best paths discovered so far.\n",
    "Exploration: Ants sometimes choose less-pheroed paths with some probability, promoting exploration of new paths and preventing premature convergence on suboptimal solutions.\n",

    "After implementing various algorithms that depend on a wide range of parameters, it is crucial to understand the impact of each parameter on the performance of the algorithm. This is why conducting an experimental study becomes a key step in evaluating and understanding the influence of each parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we performed multiple tests, varying parameters such as the number of ants (ants), alpha, and beta. Each test was carefully designed to observe how changes in these parameters affect the algorithm's performance, specifically in terms of execution time, best distance (optimal route), and the number of vehicles used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of these experiments are then visualized in graphs, which help to identify patterns and gain insights. By plotting the data, we can clearly see how different combinations of parameters affect the computation time, best route length, and other important performance metrics. This approach allows us to fine-tune the algorithm and make informed decisions about which parameters provide the best performance for the given problem.\n",

These instances are widely used in the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and provide different types of problem configurations to assess the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm under various conditions.\n",
